1. You Have the Knowledge and Skill
Understanding: You clearly know Python well enough to solve the problem on your own. This means you have the technical skills and knowledge; it’s just a matter of honing them in the right direction.
Execution: You were able to implement the solution as soon as you understood the first step. This shows that your coding skills are solid—you can execute ideas when you know where to start.
2. Your Challenge is Mainly in Problem-Solving Structure
Breaking Down Problems: Many people (even experienced developers) face a mental block when they first see a problem, especially in interviews. The fact that you found the problem easy to solve once you broke it down is very common. Often, the hardest part of coding challenges is not writing code but structuring your thought process.
Practice in Decomposition: Regular practice with problem-solving frameworks will help you naturally break down problems. One common approach is "Understanding, Planning, Implementing, and Reviewing":
Understand: Ensure you fully understand what the problem is asking.
Plan: Break down the problem into smaller steps or parts.
Implement: Write the code step-by-step.
Review: Check for errors, and consider any edge cases.
3. What to Focus on to Build Confidence
Regularly Practice Problem-Solving Techniques: Working through small coding exercises and learning how to start them (even if they seem easy) will help you get comfortable with problem breakdown. Sites like CodeWars, LeetCode, or HackerRank have different levels of problems, which can help build your confidence.
Study Problem-Solving Patterns: There are common patterns to solving programming problems, such as "sliding window," "two-pointer," "dynamic programming," and "backtracking." Knowing these can give you a toolkit to apply when you see similar challenges.
Limit Help to Initial Hints: When practicing, try setting a timer for 10 minutes. During this time, focus only on trying to understand the problem and brainstorm an approach. If you're still stuck after this, look for a hint—but try to stop at a hint instead of a full solution. This builds resilience and gradually improves your ability to navigate the problem without feeling overwhelmed.
4. Developing a Confident Mindset
Reframe "Getting Stuck" as Part of the Process: Remember, most developers—even experienced ones—get stuck. Getting stuck is part of problem-solving. The important skill is learning how to become “unstuck” on your own.
Focus on Wins Like This: Take pride in moments like this, where you only needed a hint to get started. This means you’re close to mastering these kinds of challenges. Focus on how quickly you picked up the problem after a hint and use that confidence in the next one.
Sample Self-Guided Steps for Practice
Here's a structured way to practice:

Read the Problem Statement Carefully: Imagine you’re explaining it to someone else.
Ask Yourself Key Questions: What are the inputs? What are the outputs? Are there edge cases?
Write a Small Plan: Take just 2-3 minutes to jot down the main steps.
Code the Solution: Implement step-by-step without jumping ahead.
Review the Solution: Test with a few different examples and think about any edge cases you may have missed.
With regular practice, you’ll notice that you start seeing familiar patterns in problems, and you’ll be able to apply previous solutions to new ones. Over time, your confidence will grow, and you’ll feel more prepared for interview situations.
